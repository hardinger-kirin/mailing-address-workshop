# Where is the address?

## Project Goals
1. Solidify our knowledge about pass by address
2. Review functions and selection
3. Deliver packages! :blush::love_letter:

## Important Notes
* You should work through this README document and try it on your own. If you get stuck, come to my workshop hours or ask a follow-up question on __Piazza__ to the original discussion where I posted this problem.
* Follow best practices for programming. Your code should be neat and organized (that means using indentation to section your code!) and have plenty of comments throughout. Confused? Come to my workshop hours to discuss! :blush:
* This is __not__ an actual assignment! ***You will not clone this repository and push to it.***

## Program
__Where is the address?__ :love_letter: We're going to make a program that simulates a mailing facility. The user can (1) send a package, (2) buy stamps, or (3) leave the facility. This program also uses functions, looping, and selection!

## Requirements
First, the user should be greeted. :wave:

`Welcome to the mailing facility!`

Then, we display the menu of choices to the user. The user can revisit an option as many times as they want until they choose to leave the facility. The menu is as follows:

```
(1) Send a package
(2) Buy stamps
(3) Leave the facility
```

***IMPORTANT HINT:*** __The menu itself should be a function AND options (1) and (2) should be separate functions as well. This means 3 functions total plus the main function.__

### Option 1: Send a package

This option asks the user to provide a direction (N, E, S, W) to send the package to. In the main function, this direction is displayed back to the user for confirmation.

### Option 2: Buy stamps

This option should allow the user to purchase a number of stamps and display the total back to them.

### Option 3: Leave the facility

This option should exit the program.

# Now it's time to give it a try!
